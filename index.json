These would fall largely into one of two categories:\nAcademia # These internships happen at research labs in universities and colleges (eg: University of Delhi) and government research institutions (eg: National Institute of Immunology). These labs are headed by a principal investigator (PI), who is responsible for deciding the research direction of the lab, securing funding, mentoring students and a lot more. The PI is also a professor at the institution, and may have teaching and administrative responsibilities in this regard. Most of the actual research in the lab is usually done by the rest of the members: graduate students (people pursuing their PhD or master\u0026rsquo;s degree), post-doctoral members (someone who has already received their PhD, hence post doctoral), research associates, research assistants, undergraduate students, and interns like you! Sometimes labs also have other staff like lab managers and administrative assistants. In academic labs, there may be several on-going projects that revolve around the central research theme of the lab, and each project may have one or more people working on them.\nWho are academic internships good for?\nSomeone interested in fundamental research in STEM, especially that which may be uncommon in industry. Someone interested in future work in academia (graduate school, for example). Someone who likes the dynamics of academic research groups, or believes will thrive in that setting. Industry # Industry internships are those where you would pursue scientific research in a company or a non-profit organisation. This is about as much as I can tell you, because I have never applied for or worked in industry. If someone would like to contribute to this, please email me!\nWho are industry internships good for?\nSomeone interested in applied research in STEM. Someone interested in future work in industry. Someone who likes the dynamics of industry research groups, or believes will thrive in that setting. Other research-based internships # I will add some additional kinds of research based \u0026lsquo;internships\u0026rsquo; that are somewhat non-traditional. I will name examples from biology, but I am sure similar stuff exists in other STEM fields.\nCommunity labs: These are research labs that do not fall into the category of either academia or industry. These are professionally equipped labs that encourage DIY projects from people outside traditional science, so think of them as public sandboxes that are more accessible for people to pursue research projects in. Many such labs have open projects on various topics that might be interesting or unique. Unfortunately, I don\u0026rsquo;t know know of any research community labs in India, but here is an international list anwyays. Competitions: In competitions, you design and execute a research project(s) relevant to the competition criteria and compete with other participants for a prize. The most notable that comes to my mind is the International Genetically Engineered Machine. However if the competition or your submission for the competition requires experimentation, you will need access to a lab space, which you may only find in academia, industry or a community lab. I\u0026rsquo;d like to give team Friendzymes a shout-out here, because I really liked how they built a competition team for iGEM with members from different countries. If you find you lack access to specific equipment, starting or joining a national/international group like this may be a great idea for competitions. Hobby/DIY/amateur labs: These labs are like community labs; they exist outside traditional academia and industry space, but are typically private. Don\u0026rsquo;t let the words hobby/DIY/amateur fool you; these folks do awesome science, and their research culture is unique and refreshing. A great example is Binomica Labs. These are rare (I don\u0026rsquo;t know any in India) and till date I have never seen any advertise for intern positions. Discussion groups: These groups consist of people from all walks of life, who are interested in a particular topic. These groups usually meet at a particular frequency for discussions. I have commonly observed these in theoretical fields like math. Non-research based internships # Several people who pursue science degrees do not end up choosing jobs that involve traditional scientific research. These jobs may be related to science, and will involve research, but not strictly science research. If you find you are not interested in scientific research, but you still enjoy science and research, here are some other fields you could pursue an internship in:\nScience communication through art, video, writing and more Science journalism at a science reporting or general news outlet Science policy Scientific outreach and public education Teaching and pedagogy in science Managing and marketing at science companies Again, I have poor experience here, so I\u0026rsquo;d appreciate if anyone can add more information here. The remainder of my series will focus on academic research internships as those are the ones I am most familiar with.\nRead the previous post: Internships in STEM I - Introduction Read the next post: Internships in STEM III - How Do Academic Internships Work?

But if you are really smart, you learn from other people\u0026rsquo;s experiences\u0026rdquo;. This sentiment was one that I often thought about at the start of each year during my BS-MS when I would begin looking for internships. Between 2020 and 2023, I successively got better at identifying my research interests, locating relevant labs, and applying for funding (i.e., I learned from my experiences), but I also made a lot of mistakes that I felt were avoidable if someone had just given me a heads up before. I wish I had the benefit of other people\u0026rsquo;s hindsight (i.e., learning from their experiences). I graduate this year, so I won\u0026rsquo;t be applying for any more internships, but I would like to document the cumulative sum of my experiences for others. Simply put, I will tell you about my mistakes so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to make them.\nWhy am I writing this? # This post is the first in a series that aims to be a comprehensive guide to STEM internships, covering everything I think is essential. If you are past your first year of undergrad, you have probably realised that your coursework does not provide you with the skills and knowledge needed to apply for positions. Institutions leave you to figure it out on your own through trial and error. I\u0026rsquo;ve found this approach incredibly idiotic; you\u0026rsquo;re not the first person to apply for internships, and you will not be the last. Students have been applying long enough that we really should have a systematic way to teaching new cohorts how to do it. Instead, we shrug, so people keep making the same mistakes year after year. Imagine if you tripped over a stone on a pavement, but instead of putting up a sign to warn others, we left it as it was for the next 100 people to trip over the same exact stone.\nApart from being inefficient, this system also promotes inequality. If we had a systematic way of teaching students how to apply for internships, it would help ensure that everyone starts with the same materials and knowledge. Instead what happens when we leave students alone, those who have privileges (for example, a family member is in academia) gain an additional advantage. It\u0026rsquo;s unfair, and it sucks. We can and should do better. Unfortunately, I am not in any real position of power to enact the kind of institutional change that would be needed to remedy this. Instead, here is my contribution towards that cause.\nWhat will the series look like? # In this series, I want to cover everything. Start to finish, small details and big picture. The following are my guiding principles while writing:\nAccessibility: This series will be simple to read and understand. It will be free to read, always. I hate paywalls. Information that benefits humanity should be free. Comprehensive: This series will include everything I think is required to apply, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to go hunting for left-out information. Relevant: Many guides were written by professors or non-students, so they lack perspective or miss key points. Many guides are also outdated and old. And finally, the thing that irks me most is that most articles and blogs are written by Western authors for Western audiences. High quality: I\u0026rsquo;ve read a lot of guides for applying to internships, and a good fraction is straight-up garbage. I fear that in the chatGPT age, the internet will be flooded with even more low-quality articles pumped out by LLMs. These usually offer very generic advice that is not actionable. What will the series cover? # Here are the main questions I want to answer; each will have a dedicated post.\nWhy are internships in STEM important? What kind of internships are there in STEM? How do I know what my research interests are? Where can I do my internship? How do I apply to research labs? Making the most of your internship. Some caveats # I am writing this from personal experience, so take everything with a fat grain of salt. What may be true for an experimental and computational biologist who works on bacterial genome evolution (me) may not be true for other fields and subjects in STEM. Similarly, your degree, institution, personal life and other factors may differ vastly from mine. My experience is one of many. And finally, while I may use the word \u0026lsquo;guide\u0026rsquo; while referring to these blog posts, treat them more like suggestions. If something I have written sounds irrelevant, ignore it. There\u0026rsquo;s no one way of doing this.\nIf you have suggestions or, comments or ideas, I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear them. Please email me ira (dot) zibbu (at) gmail (dot) com.

Here I was, asking my shell one of the most profound questions in human history:\n$ whoami My shell, oblivious to any such philosophical musings, always echoes the same answer back:\nira Welcome to my blog! My name is Ira Zibbu. I spend most of my time fiddling around computers and thinking about evolution. I am currently pursuing my PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology at the University of Texas at Austin. I finishied my bachelor\u0026rsquo;s and master\u0026rsquo;s degree in biology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram. I\u0026rsquo;m broadly interested in experimental evolution, evolutionary dynamics, microbial genomics and genetics, next-generation sequencing, and synthetic biology.\nPhysicists have spent a lot of time looking for a grand theory to unify the discipline; biologists were gifted one with the theory of evolution in the 19th century. I don\u0026rsquo;t think evolution alone has the explanatory power to describe all biological processes, but rather that evolution is the framework within which all of biology is contextualised. As an undergraduate, I was introduced to evolution and genetics as disparate fields In the former, the evolutionary events are explained, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are usually not investigated. In the latter, comprehensive mechanistic descriptions of biological phenomenon are uncovered, but little thought is given to the bigger picture of how these processes evolved. Fortunately, Julian Huxley (and many others) had already though about this before me, and Modern Synthesis was born 60 years before I was. We also figured out the really neat trick of sequencing nucleic acids, and blew the doors wide open for molecular evolution to grow. I was born with the proverbial silver spoon of next-generation sequencing in my mouth and have always had a deep appreciation for its power. The third of Clarke\u0026rsquo;s three laws states that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, and you cannot convince me that sequencing technologies are anything short of molecular wizardry.\nThis, I suppose, is where my research comes in. I\u0026rsquo;m drawn to abstract questions about the nature of evolution, and I fell in love with experimental evolution for its ability to answer some of these questions. Is evolution an idiosyncratic or a highly repeatable process? Can fitness increase indefinitely? How is phenotypic evolution coupled with molecular evolution? Because evolution experiments give us direct access to the intermediate transitional forms generated as a population evolves, we can essentially build a frame-by-frame \u0026lsquo;movie\u0026rsquo; of evolution. It\u0026rsquo;s also open-ended, and tends to generate very information-rich data that can be repeatedly analysed in different ways. The inherent \u0026lsquo;creativity\u0026rsquo; of the evolutionary process means evolution experiments are gifts that keep on giving.\nRight now, I work with the Lenski Long-Term Evolution Experiment, where I am trying to understand what kinds of chromosomal rearrangements have happened over 75,000 generations of the experiment. As an undergrad, I hopped around a lot and tinkered around with some machine learning and proteins, chemotaxis and PDEs and insect ecology.\nHere is some other stuff I like:\nMicrobes: They were here before us, and will be there after us. They account for the vast majority of the tree of life and exhibit incredible physiological, ecological and sequence diversity. I like lab staples like E. coli for how easy they are to handle and manipulate. They\u0026rsquo;re great for when you are asking tough questions about evolution, and need a well-understood model to work with. I also like archeae, because these microbes really push the boundaries of what is possible in a biological system.\nSynthetic biology: The Lego bricks of biology! If watching cells do neat stuff was great, then programming them to do it is even better. If you\u0026rsquo;d like, you can throw in some ideas from evolution in the mix and get directed evolution experiments.\nLinux and FOSS: I made the switch to Linux in 2023, and UNIX based systems just blew my mind. These days most of my work is bioinformatics, so switching to a UNIX-based OS was inevitable, but I can\u0026rsquo;t believe how much I missed out on, solely because [redacted] company has a monopoly over the default OS on most computers sold today. As someone put it, with Linux, you can build castles in the clouds or you can repeatedly shoot yourself in the foot. I tend to do a lot of the latter*\nI also mentor many undergraduate students with navigating science, academia and finding opportunities.

From Escherichia coli to Homo sapiens, it is a highly conserved behaviour that enables directed cell movement. For motile unicellular organisms, chemotaxis enables movement towards resources like nutrition and space and away from toxins or competitors. For multicellular organisms like metazoans, chemotaxis drives coordinated cell movements during development, such as gastrulation, germ cell migration, and neural crest cell migration. Immune cells like leukocytes use chemotaxis to move towards sites of infection. Defects in chemotaxis have been associated with diseases such as craniofacial disorders (defective neural crest cell migration) and autoimmunity (defective leukocyte chemotaxis) [1].\nTraditionally, chemotaxing cells are viewed as passive responders that only sense but do not affect an externally imposed chemoattractant gradient. The self-generated chemoattractant gradient model represent the opposite view, where a group of migrating cells produce a local gradient to enable autonomous movement. In reality, most cell migration occurs through an intermediate mechanism, where they locally modify an external gradient to some extent by endocytosis or enzymatic degradation of the attractant [1]. Most evidence for self-generated chemoattractant gradients comes from studies on unicellular organisms, while very few examples have been found in animals. In the slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum, cAMP is produced in a cell density-dependent manner, allowing chemotaxis to drive dispersal and prevent crowding. The lateral line primordium of zebrafish generates a local sdf-1 gradient for migration, and mesendoderm cells in zebrafish embryos migrate in response to a self-generated toddler gradient [3][4]. There is also evidence that a self-generated gradient drives germ cell migration in Drosophila embryos [2].\nSelf-generated chemoattractant gradients can be created by localised attractant depletion. In bacteria, cells consume nutrients in their immediate surroundings, creating a local gradient that drives movement toward other regions with higher concentrations of nutrients. In lateral line primordium in zebrafish, the posterior end of the tissue acts as a sink for sdf-1, creating a gradient directed towards the leading edge of the cell cluster. Self-generated gradients can also be produced by autorepellant secretion, which creates a gradient where concentration is highest where cell numbers are highest. For example, quorum-sensing molecules in Helicobacter pylori enable the cells to disperse from regions of high cell density and competition [2].\nSelf-generated chemoattractant gradients are hard to detect, and their advantages over externally imposed gradients are harder to demonstrate experimentally. Here, computational simulations of migrating cells become essential, and these studies have revealed some key differences. During chemotaxis, cell surface receptors detect the attractant and operate in a restricted concentration range around the receptor dissociation constant Kd. If the concentration is too high, all receptors become saturated and cannot respond to changes in concentration. If the concentration is too low, an insufficient signal is generated. Therefore, in externally imposed gradients, this restricted concentration range must be spread across the entire length of migration, creating a shallow and ‘unreadable’ gradient. In contrast, self-generated gradients are more robust for long-distance migration as they only need to create a local gradient, which can be steeper and drive stronger chemotactic response. Self-generated gradients also improve the dynamic range of attractant sensing by two orders of magnitude. In externally imposed gradients, at high concentrations, cells are overwhelmed and stall in one location. In self-generated gradients, if a region of high concentration is encountered, cells can endocytose/degrade the attractant, shifting the concentration gradient to a readable range after a time delay. This detection range is further improved if the degradation of the attractant is inducible and proportional to the local attractant concentration [1]. In cases where there is both a global and self-generated gradient of the same attractant, the local action of the cells can refine the gradient and make it more readable. For example, a linear external gradient can be locally refined to an exponential gradient to drive a stronger chemotactic response.\nExperiments with Dictyostelium discoideum have shown an additional benefit of self-generated gradients in allowing cells to gather information about regions without physically visiting them. This was demonstrated in mazes constructed in microfluidic devices with a homogeneous distribution of a chemoattractant. D. discoideum cells break down as the attractant as they enter the maze, and cells can identify which branches of a maze connect to the exit because fresh attractant diffuses in from them. In contrast, no additional attractant diffuses in dead-end branches [2]. This would not be possible if the cells did not locally break down the attractant. One shortcoming of self-generated gradients is that they fail to drive chemotaxis if cell populations are low. However, if the chemoattractant is also a mitogen (as with VEGF), self-generated gradients become robust to population drops [1].\nThe word Aatmanirbhar means ‘self-reliance’; this property of self-generated gradients makes them a robust method to drive directed cell movement. Despite the theoretically predicted advantages of self-generated chemoattractant gradients, very few instances of their occurrence in animals have been described. The dynamic and unstable nature of these gradients makes it difficult to visualise them. Fluorescently tagged chemoattractants can be used for this purpose. However, it is challenging to detect differential uptake levels across a group of migrating cells or distinguish between uptake leading to signalling and uptake leading to degradation without signalling [2]. Tandem fluorescent tags that enable visualisation of receptor age and turnover have been successfully used to demonstrate self-generated gradients [4]. As experimental techniques improve, more cases of self-generated gradients will be discovered.\nReferences # Tweedy, L. \u0026amp; Insall, R. H.

One light year is about 9.46 x 10^12 kilometres. I have an intuitive sense of what one kilometre feels like; it is roughly the distance between my house and the supermarket I frequent. I envision this distance in my head and then I multiply it– twice, thrice, five times, ten times. After a while, as the distance grows, I can feel it slipping from my mind because I’m approaching the limit of what my imagination is capable of. One light year is so monstrously large a number that no distance from my human experience can possibly be used to visualise it.\nIn April 2020, the very first image of black hole was released. It’s actually a very unremarkable looking picture– a mushy black circle with a blazing golden and orange halo. The black hole in question, M87, is 55 million light years away and weighs about 6.5 billion solar mass. The heaviest object my mind can meaningfully use as some kind of unit is the weight of an elephant. One solar mass is about 2 x 10^30 kg, or about 5 x 10^25 elephants. It’s more elephants than my brain can imagine being squished up and condensed into a black hole. I have no idea what 6.5 billion solar mass could feel or look like– it’s a mere number on the screen.\nThere is a deep feeling of awe and majesty when I think about the bigness of some things. The so-muchness of the ocean, the sun, the stars and space itself is overwhelming, but also humbling. On my 18th birthday, I got a tattoo of Voyager-1 on my right ankle, as a reminder of the bigness of the universe. There are lots of incredible things about Voyager-1 but one of my favourite is an iconic image it took on Valentine’s Day, 1990. Dubbed the ‘Pale Blue Dot’, this image is from a series of Family Portraits of the solar system Voyager-1 took that day. You can see the earth, a barely-perceptible white dot, against the backdrop of space; the entirety of human history, my own history, condensed into a single pixel and for a moment, I feel like my life is simultaneously the most significant and insignificant thing in the universe.\nThis article was originally written for Ether Magazine.

The Beginner’s Guide was released by Everything Unlimited Ltd. on 1st October, 2015 for Windows, OS X and Linux. It isn’t a video game in the traditional sense, but is very on brand for its creator, Davey Wrenden. Wreden was the brains behind The Stanley Parable (2011), another one of my favourite games. Like its predecessor, The Beginner’s Guide is an interactive storytelling game, and offers commentary on the art and process of game development.\nThe Beginner’s Guide has gameplay that is fairly straightforward, and is presented in a first person style. The narrator, Wrenden himself, walks you through a series of short unfinished and unreleased games he says were made by his friend Coda several years before. These games are surreal, often without an objective, and Wrenden offers his interpretation of them. I think it would be more apt to refer to them as interactive scenes rather, given their brevity and sometimes baffling lack of coherence. At the same time, they offer up delightful metaphors. As the player progresses through them, there is a noticeable increase in complexity and quality in these short games. I don’t want to spoil these short unfinished games for you, but each one offers a moment of ‘Wow! That is beautiful.’ when you finally understand the idea being presented by the game. Gradually, the games acquire a darker tone, with themes of despair, isolation, and creative burnout \u0026ndash; many of which are relatable. Wrenden says he initially interpreted this to mean that Coda was signalling for help. The Beginner’s Guide can be thought of as a documentation of the relationship between Coda and Wrenden.\nThere is no winning or losing; there are no puzzles to be solved, experience to be collected or levels to be unlocked. Much like The Stanley Parable, The Beginner’s Guide seeks to expand the definition of what it means to be a video game. Being a strange game with little discernible structure throws the doors open for interpretation. Some people argue that Coda is a fictional character, and simply represents another facet of Wrenden’s own psyche, while others speculate that he is a real person. My interpretation of the game is that it wants to represent game development as an artform that is a medium of expression for its creators. Each step of the way, it reminds you of the fact that it was constructed from the imagination of a real person, and invites you to draw conclusions about its creator. It also brings up some popular questions in game development: should games be playable, and puzzles solvable? Are games worth anything if they never get released and played? To what degree does the player actually have free will in the game, if its structure has already been predetermined? I could go on and on about this, but the last message of the game prevents me from doing so. The Beginner’s Guide is self-aware of the fact that it is an open ended game, but isn’t under any delusions of self-grandeur about its own artistry. It notes that not everything in it is a metaphor, and the player shouldn’t bother themselves with looking for hidden meaning where there is none. Sometimes a blue curtain isn’t an allegory for sadness or depression; it’s just a blue curtain. And so trying to sit here and offer up interpretations of the game seems pointless.\nComing to the gameplay itself, there isn’t much to say. Whatever few puzzles are scattered throughout the game, Wrenden hands you the solution to them. He is definitely the most prominent part of the game, and his role as the narrator is commendable. Some critics disliked him for supplying the player with his own interpretations of the games before they had the chance to form their own impressions. I would disagree with them, because I believe that the game is meant to give the player a direct glimpse into Wrenden’s mind, his feelings, his passion for game development, his relationship with Coda (whoever that may be), and his narration \u0026ndash; where he voices his thoughts \u0026ndash; is imperative to that objective. This game can be finished in under one sitting, and lacks replay value, but I don’t see that to be to its detriment, but rather as a natural consequence of the message it was trying to convey.\nI would highly recommend this game, although it is not everyone’s cup of tea. It is far more emotional than it originally lets on to be. If you enjoyed his other games, you will enjoy this one as well. It is unique in almost every aspect, and I look forward to seeing more like it.\nThis article was originally written for Ether Magazine.
